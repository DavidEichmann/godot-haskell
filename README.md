# godot-haskell
Haskell bindings for the Godot game engine.
* Low-level stuff (GDNative) resides in Godot.Gdnative
* Nativescript stuff (binding classes/methods/etc) is in Godot.Nativescript
* High-level stuff (classes generated from the API description) is in Godot.Api, whereas methods are in Godot.Methods

For an example project by lboklin, see addons/godot-haskell-plugin at https://gitlab.com/lboklin/godot-haskell-test/tree/godot-project

Questions, etc are best asked in the Gitter chatroom for SimulaVR: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula.svg)](https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

# Docs
The Haskell specific stuff is documented, but I'm not importing the docstrings from the Godot API yet. Refer to the Godot docs for that
